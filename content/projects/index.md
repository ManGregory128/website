Developed in Processing (Java), it is meant to visualise over 500k flights in the USA in terms of:
* Total and total diverted/cancelled/late/on-time flights, per user-selected airports as charts
* (Estimated) Carbon Emission Information, per user-selected airports. Includes a calculation of how many trees are needed to offset these estimates.

A Minecraft mod that adds giant swords and shields to the game. Made in collaboration with [ACGaming](https://github.com/ACGaming).

This mod is a re-make of the original Asgard Shield, made popular by the 1.5 modpack Hexxit.

* **Giant Swords** deal more damage than the game‘s regular swords, and can block like shields, similar to Fuzs‘ mod [Golden Age Combat](https://github.com/Fuzss/goldenagecombat) (currently a 1.12.2/1.14.4 feature only)! They‘re crafted using six pieces of the respective material.

* **Shields** (currently a 1.12.2 feature only) have special perks and weaknesses, giving each shield its unique purpose. They‘re crafted using leather and six pieces of the respective material and can be upgraded with gold for improved stats.

The mod is hosted on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/asgard-shield-reloaded) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/asgard-shield-reloaded) and its code can be found on [this repo](https://github.com/ManGregory128/asgardshieldreloaded).
