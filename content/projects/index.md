## Genesys Student Discount Bot (SwEngGroup1)

A Digital Bot flow developed in [Genesys Cloud](https://www.genesys.com/genesys-cloud) using [Architect](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/about-architect/), alongside a RESTful API the bot calls to which scrapes and returns student deals from Unidays to the bot. Developed for Trinity College Dublin's [CSU22013](https://teaching.scss.tcd.ie/module/csu22013-software-engineering-project-i/) Software Engineering Project I.

This project's workload has been split across our ten team members. I worked on creating a Java-based RESTful API using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and integrating the funtionality needed to return both web-scraped discounts and Trinity College Student Society-exclusive discounts my team gathered and stored in a SQL Database. Additionally, I used Docker to containerise the built executable and publishd it on my 'homelab' for testing. The API was successfully integrated with the bot other team members developed.

This project was my first experience working with a medium-sized team and a CI/CD pipeline and has given me fundamental insight on how software in the industry is developed. Check out Genesys at [www.genesys.com](https://www.genesys.com).

Developed in Processing (Java), it is meant to visualise over 500k flights in the USA in terms of:
* Total and total diverted/cancelled/late/on-time flights, per user-selected airports as charts
* (Estimated) Carbon Emission Information, per user-selected airports. Includes a calculation of how many trees are needed to offset these estimates.

This mod is a re-make of the original Asgard Shield, made popular by the 1.5 modpack Hexxit.

* **Giant Swords** deal more damage than the game‘s regular swords, and can block like shields, similar to Fuzs‘ mod [Golden Age Combat](https://github.com/Fuzss/goldenagecombat). They‘re crafted using six pieces of the respective material.

* **Shields** have special perks and weaknesses, giving each shield its unique purpose. They‘re crafted using leather and six pieces of the respective material and can be upgraded with gold for improved stats.

The mod is hosted on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/asgard-shield-reloaded) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/asgard-shield-reloaded) and its code can be found on [this repo](https://github.com/ManGregory128/asgardshieldreloaded).
